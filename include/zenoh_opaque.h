 * A non-tread-safe droppable context.

 * zc_context_t instance will never be executed concurrently. In other words, all the callbacks associated
 * with this context data are not required to be thread-safe.

 * discourage our users from pinning to some specific behavior unless they _really_ understand what they
 * are doing.
 *
 * Once moved to zenoh-c ownership, this context is guaranteed to execute delete_fn when deleted. The
 * delete_fn is guaranteed to be executed only once at some point of time after the last associated
 * callback call returns.
 * NOTE: if user doesn't pass the instance of this context to zenoh-c, the delete_fn callback won't
 * be executed.
